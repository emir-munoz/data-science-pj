Files:
- ranking.py: contains methods to query Twitter using given keywords. Once a tweet is retrieved, some user information is extracted and used to assign a weight of importance for that user.
- user_profile.txt: is an example of the JSON retrieved for a given user.

NOTE: Twitter allows just 150 user queries using the same credentials.
